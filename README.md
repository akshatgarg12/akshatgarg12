Hi there! My name is Akshat Garg, and I'm a software engineer based in India. I like creating web applications and tools using TypeScript, I am passionate about client facing applications involving javascript framework like React, Nextjs and Qwik and have a decent experience with developing and designing backend systems like Rest APIs, real time systems using sockets and message queue systems.  

I have worked as an software engineer intern @Microsoft and @BuilderIO and love contributing to open source projects like @Plone/volto and currently also maintaining [@BuilderIO/SSDiff](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ssdiff).

I believe programming is the way to freedom for creative minds.
